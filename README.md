# ep_images_extended – Extended image plugin for etherpad

**Insert, resize, float, copy, cut & delete images.**  
`ep_images_extended` builds on `ep_image_insert` and other image upload plugins.  
The main difference is that images are built as custom span structures using the CSS background image attribute. This bypasses the Content Collector which always requires images to be block-level styles (so they couldn't share the line with text). As a result, we can now type around images, which allows the creation of more interactive pad content. The plugin includes some other features like click + drag resize, image float, and cut/copy/delete through a context menu. It was designed for compatibility with my forthcoming tables plugin. It's a pretty heavyweight plugin (some would say overengineered), because I was prioritizing meeting functional requirements for my project. Etherpad wizards might have tips for optimization, it would surely be appreciated.

## Installation

Install via the plugins menu or through:

pnpm run plugins i ep_images_extended

in your etherpad-lite directory.

## Configuration (settings.json)

Create (or merge) an **`ep_images_extended`** block at the root of `settings.json`.

| key | type | default | description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `fileTypes` | Array&lt;string&gt; | _none_ | List of **extensions** (no dot) that are allowed to upload.  If omitted any MIME that starts with `image/` is accepted. |
| `maxFileSize` | Number (bytes) | _unlimited_ | Reject files larger than this size. |
| `storage` | Object | `{ "type": "base64" }` | Where the image binary ends up.  See below. |

### Storage strategies

1. **Embedded Base-64** (default – zero config)
   ```jsonc
      "ep_images_extended": {
        "storage": {               
          "type": "base64" 
        },
        "fileTypes": ["jpeg", "jpg", "png", "gif", "bmp", "webp"],
        "maxFileSize": 5000000
      }
   ```
   Images are converted to data-URIs and live inside the pad. This has a pretty big performance impact.

2. **Amazon S3 with presigned uploads**
   ```jsonc
   "ep_images_extended": {
     "storage": {
       "type":   "s3_presigned",
       "region": "us-east-1",
       "bucket": "my-etherpad-images",
       "publicURL": "https://cdn.example.com/",    // optional – defaults to the S3 URL
       "expires": 900                               // optional – seconds (default 600)
     },
     "fileTypes": ["png", "jpg", "webp"],
     "maxFileSize": 10485760
   }
   ```
   The browser asks the Etherpad server for a presigned **PUT** URL, then uploads straight to S3 –
   the file never touches your app server. Access keys are **not** read from `settings.json`.*  The AWS SDK picks them up from environment variables.
   
   * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   * `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (if using temporary credentials)
   
3. **Local disk storage** (files saved on the Etherpad server)
   ```jsonc
   "ep_images_extended": {
     "storage": {
       "type": "local",                 // enable disk uploads
       "baseFolder": "static/images",   // optional – path relative to Etherpad root
       "baseURL": "https://pad.example.com/etherpad-lite/static/images/" // optional – public URL prefix
     },
     "fileTypes": ["jpeg", "jpg", "png", "gif"],
     "maxFileSize": 5000000
   }
   ```
   The browser POSTs the file to `/pluginfw/ep_images_extended/upload`.
   Etherpad writes it to `baseFolder/<padId>/<uuid>.ext` and returns the
   public URL.

## Export support

This plugin does not register Etherpad export hooks. Image attributes remain available to Etherpad's normal content collection and timeslider rendering, but special HTML/DOCX export rendering is currently outside this plugin's supported surface. The old partial export implementation was removed because it could interfere with unrelated exports.
